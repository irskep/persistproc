### The Problem: Competing Agents, Siloed Processes

In the current era of rapid AI development, it's common to switch between multiple tools and AI agents. This often leads to a frustrating and common scenario:

You start your app's frontend `webpack` dev server in iTerm. It's running perfectly.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Your Environment"
        A[iTerm] -- "runs" --> P1[Webpack Dev Server];
        B[Cursor];
        C[Claude Code];
    end
    style P1 fill:#d4edda,stroke:#c3e6cb
```

Then, you move to **Cursor** to make a change to your `webpack.config.js`. The LLM assistant, trying to be helpful, attempts to start the server on its ownâ€”but it fails, because you're already running it. The port is already in use.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Your Environment"
        A[iTerm] -- "runs" --> P1[Webpack Dev Server: Port 3000];
        B[Cursor] -- "tries to run (FAILS!)" --> P2[Webpack Dev Server: Port 3000];
        C[Claude Code];
    end
    style P1 fill:#d4edda,stroke:#c3e6cb
    style P2 fill:#f8d7da,stroke:#f5c6cb
```

Next, you switch to **Claude Code** to do some other work that eventually requires a server restart. But Claude has no way of restarting the process running in iTerm, so it asks you to do it manually, wasting your time and breaking your flow.

Your development processes are trapped in the environment they were started in. Each agent is blind to the others, leading to conflicts and manual intervention.

### The Solution: A Shared Process Hub

`persistproc` solves this by decoupling your processes from your terminal sessions. It runs a single, lightweight server in the background that acts as a central hub for all your development processes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Your Agents"
        A[iTerm];
        B[Cursor];
        C[Claude Code];
    end

    subgraph "The persistproc Hub"
        Hub(persistproc server);
        P1[Webpack Dev Server];
        Hub -- manages --> P1;
    end
    
    A <--> Hub;
    B <--> Hub;
    C <--> Hub;

    subgraph "Result"
        R1["Any agent can start, stop, restart, or read logs from any process."]
    end

```

With `persistproc`, your dev server is no longer a siloed process but a shared resource for your entire development environment.

- **Start a process** from iTerm (or have an agent do it).
- **Restart it** from Cursor.
- **Check its logs** from Claude Code.
- No more port conflicts. No more manual restarts. No more copy/pasting output.

## Primary Workflow: Agent-Driven Control

### 1. Start the `persistproc` Server
This is the core daemon that will manage everything. You only need to do this once. Run it in a dedicated terminal window and keep it running. This makes it easy to see server-level activity at a glance.

```bash
persistproc --serve
```
The server will now be running, ready to accept commands from any agent.

### 2. Configure Your AI Agents
For your AI agents (in Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) to use `persistproc`, they need to know where its MCP server is.

#### Cursor / VS Code
In your editor's `settings.json` file, add the following to the `mcp.servers` configuration:
```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "persistproc": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8947/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```
Now, agents in Cursor can see and interact with `persistproc`.

### 3. Let Your Agents Start Processes
This is the primary way to start processes. Instead of running commands yourself, you ask your agent to do it.

For example, you can ask your assistant in Cursor:
> "start the webpack dev server"

The agent, now aware of `persistproc`, won't just run a blind shell command. It will see the `start_process` tool and use it correctly: `start_process(command="npm run dev")`.

`persistproc` will start the server, manage it, and report its status and `pid` back to the agent. The process is now available to *all* your agents.

### 4. Manage Processes from Anywhere
Now, the real power emerges. You can switch to a different agent or tool and manage the process you just started.

For example, you can later ask an agent in Claude Code:
> "restart the webpack server"

The agent will see the running processes via `list_processes()` and can call `restart_process(pid=...)` to perform the action. No more port conflicts. No more manual restarts.

## Direct Terminal Usage (Optional)
While the main power comes from agent integration, you can also use the `persistproc` command as a simple client from your own terminal. This is useful for starting a process and immediately tailing its logs in one go:

```bash
# In iTerm, for example:
persistproc npm run dev
```
Press `Ctrl+C` to stop tailing the logs. The process will **keep running** in the background, managed by the server. To manage this process (e.g., restart or stop it), you would typically use an integrated AI agent that can call the appropriate MCP tools.

## Advanced Management

`persistproc` exposes a standard [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontext.com/) server on `http://127.0.0.1:8947`. You can use any MCP-compatible client to interact with it programmatically for more advanced tasks.

The server exposes the following tools:
- `list_processes()`
- `get_process_status(pid: int)`
- `stop_process(pid: int, force: bool = False)`
- `restart_process(pid: int)`
- `get_process_output(...)`
- `get_process_log_paths(pid: int)`

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/irskep/persistproc-mcp.git
    cd persistproc-mcp
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment:**
    This project uses `uv` for environment and package management.
    ```bash
    uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    uv pip install -e .
    ```

3.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    persistproc --serve
    ```
