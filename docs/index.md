## The Problem We Solve

When using multiple AI agents and development tools simultaneously, a common problem emerges: **process isolation**.

### Without persistproc

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Your Environment"
        A[iTerm] -- "runs" --> P1[Webpack Dev Server];
        B[Cursor] -- "tries to run (FAILS!)" --> P2[Webpack Dev Server];
        C[Claude Code] -- "asks you to restart manually" --> P3[Manual Intervention];
    end
    style P1 fill:#d4edda,stroke:#c3e6cb
    style P2 fill:#f8d7da,stroke:#f5c6cb
    style P3 fill:#fff3cd,stroke:#ffeaa7
```

**Problems:**
- Port conflicts when agents try to start the same service
- Manual restarts breaking development flow
- No visibility into running processes across tools

### With persistproc

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Your Agents"
        A[iTerm];
        B[Cursor];
        C[Claude Code];
    end

    subgraph "The persistproc Hub"
        Hub(persistproc server);
        P1[Webpack Dev Server];
        P2[API Server];
        P3[Database];
        Hub -- manages --> P1;
        Hub -- manages --> P2;
        Hub -- manages --> P3;
    end
    
    A <--> Hub;
    B <--> Hub;
    C <--> Hub;
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Any agent can start, stop, restart processes
- ‚úÖ No port conflicts
- ‚úÖ Shared process visibility
- ‚úÖ Persistent logs across sessions

## Key Features

### ü§ñ **Agent-First Design**
Built specifically for modern AI-assisted development workflows. Works seamlessly with Cursor, Claude Code, and any MCP-compatible tool.

### üîÑ **Process Persistence**
Your development servers survive terminal sessions, tool switches, and environment changes.

### üìä **Centralized Management**
One hub to rule them all. Start, stop, restart, and monitor all your development processes from anywhere.

### üîç **Rich Observability**
Real-time logs, process status, and detailed output capture for all managed processes.

### üåê **Universal Access**
Access via CLI, MCP tools, or HTTP API. Your processes are available however you need them.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 3 steps:

### 1. Install persistproc

```bash
pip install persistproc
```

### 2. Start the Server

```bash
persistproc --serve
```

### 3. Configure Your AI Agent

=== "Cursor/VS Code"

    Add to your `settings.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "mcp.servers": {
        "persistproc": {
          "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8947/mcp/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Claude Code"

    ```bash
    claude mcp add --transport http persistproc http://127.0.0.1:8947/mcp/
    ```

AI agents can now manage development processes collaboratively.

## Real-World Workflow Example

Here's how persistproc transforms a typical web development session:

!!! example "Multi-Agent Web Development"

    **Scenario**: Building a React app with multiple agents.

    1. **Start Development** (in iTerm):
       ```bash
       persistproc npm run dev
       ```
       Your React dev server starts and logs stream to your terminal.

    2. **Make Changes** (in Cursor):
       Ask your AI assistant: *"The webpack config needs updating for the new CSS framework"*
       
       The assistant makes changes, then says: *"I'll restart the dev server for you"* and uses the `restart_process` tool.

    3. **Debug Issues** (in Claude Code):
       Ask: *"Check the dev server logs for any errors"*
       
       The assistant uses `get_process_output` to analyze recent logs and provides insights.

    4. **Add New Service** (anywhere):
       *"Start the API server too"* ‚Üí `start_process(command="npm run api")`

    **Result**: Seamless collaboration between you and your AI agents, with zero manual process management.

## Why persistproc?

### For Developers
- **Eliminate Context Switching**: Stop manually managing processes across different tools
- **Reduce Friction**: Let your AI agents handle the boring stuff
- **Improve Reliability**: No more "works on my machine" process issues

### For AI Agents
- **Better Tool Integration**: Standard MCP interface for process management
- **Shared State**: Consistent view of running processes across all agents
- **Rich Context**: Access to logs, status, and process history

### For Teams
- **Consistent Environments**: Same process management across all team members
- **Better Debugging**: Centralized logs and process monitoring
- **Simplified Onboarding**: One tool to manage all development processes
